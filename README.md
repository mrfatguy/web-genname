# Web GenName

This is a web version of my [very old Delphi project](https://github.com/mrfatguy/delphi-genname). And [here is](https://mrfatguy.github.io/web-genname/) its on-line version.

I use it to generate names for games, books, poetry, avatars, socials etc. It is able to generate different name sets including fantasty (more and less known) and human names (in many languages or from many culture types).

If need some other tool for any other reason (for random names of a human beings rather than some trolls and other fantasty creatures), you may consider [Random Name Generator](https://www.namespedia.com/random-name-generator.php) from [Namespedia](https://www.namespedia.com/) or [Students of the World website](http://www.studentsoftheworld.info/penpals/stats.php3) as a replacement.

## Database Authors

Names of original databases / dictionary files contents, in order of appearance:

- Johan Danforth,
- Laurent Dionisi and
- Nathalie Hebert.

That's all about fantasy names. As for human names, with the exception for two dictionary files for an extinct races (Gauls and Vikings, made by Johan Danforth), I'm myself an author of all these databases.
